# Search_engineV1.0
This project marks the culmination of my Bachelorâ€™s studies and focuses on exploring the intricacies of internet functionality and search engine operations. The primary goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how the internet functions, including the underlying technologies and protocols that enable it. Additionally, the project aims to investigate the mechanisms behind search engines, which are crucial tools for navigating the vast expanse of the web.

To achieve this, I will undertake the development of a basic search engine. The project will involve several key components:

    1-Crawling: Creating a web crawler to systematically browse and index web pages. This involves writing code to fetch and store content from various websites.

    2-Indexing: Developing a method for organizing and storing the collected data in a way that facilitates efficient searching. This includes parsing and structuring the content to enable quick retrieval.

    3-Searching: Implementing a search algorithm that allows users to input queries and retrieve relevant results from the indexed data. This involves designing and coding a query processing system that ranks and displays results based on relevance.

    User Interface: Designing a simple yet functional user interface that enables users to interact with the search engine, input search queries, and view results.

Throughout this project, I will leverage various programming languages and tools to build and test each component, gaining hands-on experience with web technologies and search engine principles.
python: 
  UI: User Interface for search and display results.
