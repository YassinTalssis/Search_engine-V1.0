Administrators are able to modify account creator, autopatrolled, confirmed, file mover, extended confirmed, mass message sender, new page reviewer, page mover, pending changes reviewer, rollback, template editor rights and AutoWikiBrowser access.\nEditors wishing to request a permission flag here should do so following the procedure below.  Editors requesting permissions are advised to periodically revisit the requests page, as notifications will not always be given after a decision is made.  Editors should not expect their request to be answered right away and should remember to be patient when filing a request.  To find out what permissions your account has, go to Special:Preferences, where your permissions are listed in the user profile tab under \"Member of groups\".\nRequests for permissions are archived regularly; please see Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Archive for an index of past requests.\n\n\nIf this page has been recently modified, it may not reflect the most recent changes.Please purge this page to view the most recent changes.\nBot report: No errors!

The flag removes the limit on the maximum number of new accounts that can be created in a 24 hour period. It also allows users to make accounts with names similar to other accounts. The account creator flag is only given to users who participate in the ACC process and may be removed without notice should a user's participation in the account creation process cease.\nAutopatrolled (add request \u2022 view requests): The autopatrolled flag is granted to users who are active in the creation of new articles. This tool is granted so their creations are auto patrolled in Special:NewPages. Unlike other requests, any user may nominate an editor for Autopatrolled, even without that user's consent. A user who wishes to have this flag generally should have created at least 25 articles and must be trusted, experienced, and must have demonstrated they are familiar with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, especially WP:BLP and Wikipedia:Notability.\nAutoWikiBrowser (add request \u2022 view requests): AutoWikiBrowser is a semi-automated MediaWiki editor for Microsoft Windows, designed to make tedious repetitive tasks quicker and easier. It is essentially a browser that automatically opens up a new page when the last is saved. When set to do so, it suggests some changes (typically formatting) that are generally meant to be incidental to the main change. Please read the quick guide on the main page before requesting permission. This is not a true user right, but access needs to be granted by administrators just like other permissions. If approved, your name will be added to the CheckPage. Users with under 250 non-automated mainspace edits or 500 total mainspace edits are rarely approved. You will need to give a reason for wanting AWB access.\nConfirmed (add request \u2022 view requests): The confirmed flag may be granted to new users who have not yet hit the threshold for autoconfirmed status. These are users who have not had both 10 edits and 4 days experience. People with this flag can  upload files and edit semi-protected pages before hitting the autoconfirmed flag. Users requesting this flag must indicate clearly why they should be exempted from the customary confirmation period.\nEvent coordinator (add request \u2022 view requests): The event coordinator user right allows editors to create multiple new accounts, and to temporarily confirm accounts so that they can create new articles.\nExtended confirmed (add request \u2022 view requests): The extended confirmed flag is normally automatically added to accounts after 500 edits and 30 days, but may be added to legitimate alternate accounts of users that already have this access. The flag allows users to edit pages under extended confirmed protection.\nFile mover (add request \u2022 view requests): The file mover user right is intended to allow users experienced in working with files to rename them, subject to policy, with the ease that autoconfirmed users already enjoy when renaming Wikipedia articles.\nMass message sender (add request \u2022 view requests): Mass message sender enables users to send messages to multiple users at once. This flag is given to users who have made requests for delivery in the past, clearly showing an understanding of the guidance for use.\nNew page reviewer (add request \u2022 view requests): The new page reviewer user right allows users to mark pages as patrolled and use the page curation toolbar. At administrators' discretion, the right may be accorded on a time limited basis or indefinite.\nPage mover (add request \u2022 view requests): The page mover user right allows users experienced in working with article names to move them, subject to policy, without leaving behind a redirect. They may also move all subpages when moving the parent page(s). General guidelines include making 3,000 edits and 6 months of editing history. At administrators' discretion, the right may be accorded on a time limited basis or indefinite.\nPending changes reviewer (add request \u2022 view requests): The reviewer flag is granted to users who are experienced enough with Wikipedia editing and its policies for contributing to the process of reviewing articles placed under pending changes.\nRollback (add request \u2022 view requests): Rollback enables users to remove vandalism much more quickly and efficiently than by undoing it. Users who do not demonstrate an understanding of what constitutes capable vandalism fighting, either because they have no or little history of doing so, or show a poor ability to discern between good and bad faith edits will not be granted this right. Also, it is unlikely that editors with under 200 mainspace edits will have their request granted. For a more detailed explanation of rollback and information about when it is appropriate to use the tool, see Wikipedia:Rollback. For information about the technical details of the feature, see here.\nTemplate editor (add request \u2022 view requests): The template editor flag allows users to edit protected templates and Lua modules. General guidelines for granting include making at least 1,000 edits overall (with at least 150 to templates or modules), being a registered user for over a year, and having a record of successfully proposing significant edits to several protected templates. Users should demonstrate proficiency with template syntax and an understanding of the need for caution when editing heavily-used templates.\nHandled elsewhere\nSeveral permissions are requested and handled elsewhere:\n\nAdministrator and bureaucrat access: Requests for administrator or bureaucrat access need to be posted at requests for adminship and requests for bureaucratship, respectively.\nBots: Request for bot flags should be made at Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval.\nEdit filter: Requests for access to the edit filter manager group and the edit filter helper group should be made at Wikipedia:Edit filter noticeboard.\nInterface administrator: Requests for interface administrator access should be made at Wikipedia:Bureaucrats' noticeboard. Only current administrators may become interface administrators.\nIP-block-exempt: While the IP-block-exempt right can be granted by administrators, this flag is not handled here. Requests for the IP-block exempt right should be submitted via the Unblock Ticket Request System or, if there are significant privacy concerns, email the checkuser team at checkuser-en-wpwikipedia.org or contact a CheckUser directly.\nCheckuser and Oversight: These rights are only granted by the Arbitration Committee, and only after strict scrutiny. More information can be found here.\nAfC reviewer: This access is granted by administrators at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Articles for creation/Participants.\nRedirect patrol whitelist: Addition to the whitelist is granted by administrators at Wikipedia talk:New pages patrol/Redirect whitelist.\nSteward permissions can only be granted in yearly elections, and are rarely given.\nGlobal permissions such as global renamer, sysop, IP block exempt, rollback, etc should be made at meta:Steward requests/Global permissions.\nRemoval of permissions\nIf you wish to have any of your permission flags (except administrator) removed, you should contact an administrator. If you want your administrator flag removed, you should contact a bureaucrat.\nThis is not the place to request review of another user's rights. If you believe someone's actions merit removal of a permission flag, you should raise your concern at the incidents noticeboard. \nThe bureaucrat, checkuser, and oversight flags are removed at meta:Steward requests/Permissions. Stewards will typically not carry out such requests unless they are made on behalf of the Arbitration Committee, by a user who is requesting their own access be removed, or in cases of an emergency.\n\nProcess\nRequestors\nTo make a request for a permission, click \"add request\" next to the appropriate header and fill in the reason for wanting permission.\nAny editor may comment on requests for permission.\n\nAdministrators\nFull instructions at Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Administrator instructions\nAdministrators are permitted to grant account creator, autopatrolled, confirmed, event coordinator, file mover, mass message sender, page mover, pending changes reviewer, rollback and template editor flags to any user who meets the criteria explained above and can be trusted not to abuse the tool(s). Administrators may either grant these permissions permanently or temporarily. For convenience, a bot will automatically comment with relevant data if the user does not meet configurable qualifications. Even if the bot does not comment, administrators should review the user's contributions and logs to ensure the tools will be used appropriately and check for any indication of potential misuse.\nOnce an administrator has granted a permission or decided to deny a request, they should add {{done}} or {{not done}} respectively under the request with their comments. If a user already has the requested permission, or is autoconfirmed and requesting confirmed, {{already done}} should be used. N hours after the last comment was made (as specified by the config), the request will be archived automatically: approved requests will be placed here; declined requests will go here. See User:MusikBot/PermClerk#Archiving for more information on archiving functionality.\n\n\nCurrent requests\nAccount creator\nSorry, please be aware that unregistered users cannot be granted permissions due to technical restrictions.

While 13 of these articles are deleted, it shouldn't be too much of a concern as these are recreated by other editors. MarioJump83! 14:26, 5 April 2021 (UTC)\nRegarding my stats, I consider my self to have authored or co-authored 30 full articles. Most of the deleted pages were redirects; those were deleted because either the main page (the redirect target) go deleted or because a later RfD on a group of redirects saw a consensus that axed some of them. I create a lot of redirects as an editor, but I've been starting more articles recently. And I plan to make more articles in the near future (I have at least 4 planned out). None of my articles were ever deleted for notability or Copyvio issues, and none of my recent article creations had any serious issues, either.

Resubmiting my request for Autopatroll rights (Earlier, my request was denied because of falling short in numbers). I'm working on NRHP entities and creating stub/start articles.

It's an honor. However, as I always say, any decision should be taken without any biases and without being influenced. If my edit history holds any merit, then I would be qualified for autopatrol rights. If not, then you guys are with me to build new articles, so that I can qualify for it next time.\u00a0:-).

To be honest, I can't even make sense of your request, it's not at all clear if you even know what it is you are applying for.

I have been editing since December 2017 and have created 683 pages as of this submission. 34 of these pages have been deleted, though 10 have been re-created since. I am happy with and proud of my track record. I mostly edit within the subject area of American politics and specialize in state legislators. I have found that, unfortunately, many members of state houses and senates around the United States do not have pages. I should also note that a significant portion of these are women and/or BIPOC. I have made it a habit to create these pages semi-rapidly, and understand that this can create an unnecessary workload for page reviewers. Thank you.

In fact, I'm preparing myself to make more articles here in wiki (primarily Tropical cyclones), that's why I'm on semi-wikibreak.

Take {{Expand French}} as an example. This template categorizes articles by default into Category:Articles needing translation from French Wikipedia, which currently contains ~4,000 articles and 14 subcats  (see the /doc). Use of the parameter where appropriate (|topic=geo, |topic=cult, etc.) will move these articles to one of the subcats instead, relieving the pressure on the parent category, and placing these articles in the proper subcat. For example, use of 'geo' will place them in Category:Geography articles needing translation from French Wikipedia. I started on this already, but it's tedious and highly repetitive, involving addition of topic params to existing {{Expand French}} templates. (And then there's 'Expand Spanish', and dozens of other daughter-language templates of 'Expand language'.) Thanks. Mathglot (talk) 19:58, 9 May 2021 (UTC)\n\u00a0Done.

There were multiple diffs in your contributions where you had undone something that didn't immediately look like obvious vandalism, like this, for example. In this situations, you need to provide a reason for your revert. There are also a few instances of you incorrectly undoing changes. This edit is entirely sourced; I haven't checked the validity of any claims nor the reliability of the sources, but this is not a situation where you blanketly revert. If it looks promotional (which it does, somewhat), you need to mention that. Similarly, this is neither a test edit or vandalism.

I've been working against vandalism for a good bit, and the rollback permissions would enable me to do this with much greater efficiency.

I believe that I can help fight vandalism even better with these user rights.

I've been reverting vandalism on Wikipedia for a little under a year now (albeit with a 4-month wikibreak), and I recently completed WP:CVUA through Cassiopeia (see here). I'd like rollback rights to continue this effort, especially by using Huggle. Thanks in advance for your consideration!
