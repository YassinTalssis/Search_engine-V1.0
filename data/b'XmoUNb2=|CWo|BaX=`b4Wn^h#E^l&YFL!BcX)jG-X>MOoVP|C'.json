He was accepted to Harvard College at the age of 16 and, after graduating and earning his PhD, he taught at UC Berkeley for three years. He then moved to a small cabin in Montana to pursue a simple life. Kaczynski began sending mail bombs to people associated with universities, airlines, and the advancement of modern technology in 1978. He mailed a total of sixteen bombs, killing 3 people and injuring 23 others. Kaczynski's bombing campaign came under investigation by the FBI, who employed over 150 people in the most expensive FBI investigation ever conducted at the time. Kaczynski's manifesto, an anarcho-primitivist essay, was published in The Washington Post on the condition that he would desist from terrorism. He was eventually arrested in 1996 (mug shot pictured) and later imprisoned at ADX Florence in Colorado.

It exists in two versions, both believed to be authentic works of Caravaggio; one is in the collection of the Fondazione Roberto Longhi in Florence, while the other, shown here, is in the National Gallery, London. The identity of the sitter (theorised to be Mario Minniti) and the symbolism of the painting have been the subjects of much debate.\n\nPainting credit: Caravaggio\n\nRecently featured: \nSt Cyprian's, Clarence Gate\nProboscis monkey\nMary Lou Williams\n\n\nArchive\nMore featured pictures\n\n\n\n\n\nOther areas of Wikipedia\n\nCommunity portal \u2013 Bulletin board, projects, resources and activities covering a wide range of Wikipedia areas.\nHelp desk \u2013 Ask questions about using Wikipedia.\nLocal embassy \u2013 For Wikipedia-related communication in languages other than English.\nReference desk \u2013 Serving as virtual librarians, Wikipedia volunteers tackle your questions on a wide range of subjects.\nSite news \u2013 Announcements, updates, articles and press releases on Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation.\nVillage pump \u2013 For discussions about Wikipedia itself, including areas for technical issues and policies.\n\nWikipedia's sister projects\n\nWikipedia is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization that also hosts a range of other projects:\n\n\n\n\n\nCommonsFree media repository\n\n\n\nMediaWikiWiki software development\n\n\n\nMeta-WikiWikimedia project coordination\n\n\n\nWikibooksFree textbooks and manuals\n\n\n\nWikidataFree knowledge base\n\n\n\nWikinewsFree-content news\n\n\n\nWikiquoteCollection of quotations\n\n\n\nWikisourceFree-content library\n\n\n\nWikispeciesDirectory of species\n\n\n\nWikiversityFree learning tools\n\n\n\nWikivoyageFree travel guide\n\n\n\nWiktionaryDictionary and thesaurus\n\n\n\nWikipedia languages\n\n\nThis Wikipedia is written in English.
