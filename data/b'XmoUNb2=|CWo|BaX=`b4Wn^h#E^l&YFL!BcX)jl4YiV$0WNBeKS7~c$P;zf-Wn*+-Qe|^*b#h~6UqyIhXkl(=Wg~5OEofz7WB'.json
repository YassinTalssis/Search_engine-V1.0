Some Wikipedians have limited or no access to information sources; other users have access to resources that are difficult to find or are cost-prohibitive for most people. This project tries to bring those two sides together, so that someone looking for a source to back an edit, can easily ask a member of the Resource Exchange to provide a relevant document. Basically, we are trying to create kind of a virtual library.\n\nContents\n\n1 How it works\n2 Guidelines and tips\n\n2.1 Use of the resources\n2.2 Input of participants\n2.3 Other options\n\n\n3 Open tasks\n4 Project tools\n\n4.1 Categories\n4.2 Subpages\n4.3 Templates\n\n\n5 Resources\n6 See also\n\n\nHow it works[edit]\nThis project has two main features:\n\nShared Resources: a list of resources available to other Wikipedians.\nAdd your own resources here in the appropriate section.\nSearch this list if you're looking for a source and ask the Wikipedian who left his or her name for help.\nResource Request.\nRequest a specific article or document, or request a specific search in a commercial full-text newspaper/journal database or another information database. The participants of this project try to track down your request and e-mail it to you.\nGuidelines and tips[edit]\nUse of the resources[edit]\nUsers should note that these shared usage offers are only valid for Wikipedia purposes.\nIt's best to first scan the Shared Resources list, before placing a request on the Resource Request page. That way, you avoid a lot of unnecessary work for the  participants involved.\nThere are other language versions of this WikiProject offering library help. A lot of other language libraries have access to a wide variety of English material, and most likely you'll get help in English too. You can find those projects by using the links in the 'languages' navigation box.\nMost of the time, the offered sources are not public domain resources. They may be helpful references, but you are not allowed to publish them, pass them on, use them for commercial purposes or use them verbatim for Wikipedia articles. Some public domain resources can be found in the navigation box above.\nInput of participants[edit]\nAnyone can add their resources to the list or fill requests, no need to sign up anywhere.\nIt is assumed that the resources you offer are available to you for free or that you are willing to cover any costs.\nOther options[edit]\nMany databases and other online publications that are normally paid for are available for free for personal use at many public libraries, often requiring only a library card, itself available for free to local people.\nAn interlibrary loan service is available at most local libraries, in many cases for free. Consider this as an option when you have a specific work in mind. Such a service will almost always be faster and more reliable than this project.\nOpen tasks[edit]\nAdd your own sources to the Shared Resources, or help solve requests on the Resource Request.\nExpand the list of articles in the Category:WikiProject Resource Exchange articles. Find fitting articles on Wikipedia about an information resource, and add the {{WikiProject Resource Exchange}} template to the talk page.\nPlace links to the Resource Exchange on related project pages.\nProject tools[edit]\nCategories[edit]\n\n\nClick on \"\u25ba\" below to display subcategories:\n\n\n\u25ba  WikiProject Resource Exchange\n\n\n\nClick on \"\u25ba\" below to display subcategories:\n\n\n\u25ba  Wikipedia sources\n\n\n\nClick on \"\u25ba\" below to display subcategories:\n\n\n\u25ba  WikiProject reference libraries\n\nSubpages[edit]\nList of all subpages of this page\nTemplates[edit]\n{{WikiProject Resource Exchange}} - for talk pages of related articles\n{{User WikiProject Resource Exchange}} - userbox for participants\n{{Diligent Librarian Barnstar}} - barnstar award for exceptional valour in delivering up the sources (please list recipients on the template talk page.)\nResources[edit]\nWikipedia:Book sources\nWikipedia:Journal sources\nWikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check - project that actively verifies articles.\nWikipedia:WikiProject Unreferenced articles - project that adds references to unreferenced articles\nde:Wikipedia:Bibliotheksrecherche (Library research) - alternative German version of this project, with a lot of English material.\nList of academic databases and search engines\nList of digital library projects\nList of scientific journals\nWikipedia:Free English newspaper sources\nWikipedia:United States government document search tools\nSee also[edit]\nWikipedia:Forward to Libraries\nWikipedia:WikiProject Bibliographical Database\nWikipedia:WikiProject Open Access\nWikipedia:The Wikipedia Library\nvte\u00a0WikiProject Council\u00a0WikiProject guides\nWikiProject Council\nTalk\nGuidelines/Intro\nWikiProjects\nTask forces\nTechnical notes\nAssessment FAQ\nWork via WikiProjects\n\u00a0Directories and summaries\nDirectory\nProposals\nSignpost\nShortcuts\nPopular pages\nDatabase reports\nWatchers\n\u00a0Culture and the arts\nArts\nMusic\nPerforming\nPlastic\nVisual\nBroadcasting\nCrafts and hobbies\nEntertainment\nGames and toys\nFood and drink\nInternet culture\nLanguage and literature\nBiography\nLinguistics\nMedia\nPhilosophy and religion\nSports\n\u00a0Geographical\nBodies of water\nCities\nCountries\nAfrica\nAmericas\nAsia\nEurope\nOceania\nLandforms\nMaps\nParks, conservation areas and historical sites\n\u00a0History and society\nHistory and society\nBusiness and economics\nEducation\nMilitary and warfare\nPolitics and government\nTransportation\n\u00a0Science, technologyand engineering\nScience\nBiology\nChemistry\nEconomics\nGeosciences\nInformation science\nMathematics\nMedicine\nMeteorology\nPhysics\nSpace\nTechnology\nTime\n\u00a0Wikipedia assistanceand tasks\nContents systems\nMaintenance\nFiles\nArticle improvement and grading\nClassroom projects\nWikiProjects\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Resource_Exchange&oldid=1019520900\"\nCategories: Active WikiProjectsWikiProject Resource ExchangeWikipedia WikiProjectsWikipedia sourcesWikipedia resources for researchersHidden categories: Project pages with short description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nNot logged inTalkContributionsCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\nNamespaces\n\n\nProject pageTalk\n\n\n\n\n\nVariants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViews\n\n\nReadEditView history\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\n\nMain pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonate\n\n\n\n\nContribute\n\n\nHelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload file\n\n\n\n\nTools\n\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPermanent linkPage informationWikidata item\n\n\n\n\nPrint/export\n\n\nDownload as PDFPrintable version\n\n\n\n\nLanguages\n\n\n\u010ce\u0161tinaDanskDeutsch\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03acEspa\u00f1olF\u00f8roysktFran\u00e7ais\u0a97\u0ac1\u0a9c\u0ab0\u0abe\u0aa4\u0ac0\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940Italiano\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05eaNorsk bokm\u00e5lPolskiPortugu\u00eas\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0648\u7cb5\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\nEdit links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 23 April 2021, at 20:02\u00a0(UTC).\nText is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License;\nadditional terms may apply.
