Python allows mandatory and optional arguments, keyword arguments, and even arbitrary argument lists.

Lists can be indexed, sliced and manipulated with other built-in functions.

Whet your appetite with our Python\u00a03 overview.\n\n\n\n# For loop on a list\r\n>>> numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]\r\n>>> product = 1\r\n>>> for number in numbers:\r\n...    product = product * number\r\n... \r\n>>> print('The product is:', product)\r\nThe product is: 384\nAll the Flow You\u2019d Expect\nPython knows the usual control flow statements that other languages speak \u2014 if, for, while and range \u2014 with some of its own twists, of course.
