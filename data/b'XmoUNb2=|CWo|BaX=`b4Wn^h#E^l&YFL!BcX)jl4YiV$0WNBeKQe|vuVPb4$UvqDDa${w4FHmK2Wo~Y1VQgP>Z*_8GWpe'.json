This page is intended to provide additional information about concepts in the page(s) it supplements. This page is not one of Wikipedia's policies or guidelines, as it has not been thoroughly vetted by the community.ShortcutWP:RSP\nThis page in a nutshell: This is a list of repeatedly discussed sources, collected and summarized for convenience. Consensus can change, and context matters tremendously when determining how to use this list.\n The reliability of a source greatly affects what information it can be used to support, or whether it should be used at all.\nThis is a non-exhaustive list of sources whose reliability and use on Wikipedia are frequently discussed. This list summarizes prior consensus and consolidates links to the most in-depth and recent discussions from the reliable sources noticeboard and elsewhere on Wikipedia.\n\nClick here to see the list of frequently-discussed sources.\nContext matters tremendously, and some sources may or may not be suitable for certain uses depending on the situation. When in doubt, defer to the linked discussions for more detailed information on a particular source and its use. Consensus can change, and if more recent discussions considering new evidence or arguments reach a different consensus, this list should be updated to reflect those changes.\nReliability is an inquiry that takes place pursuant to the verifiability policy and the reliable sources guideline. Note that verifiability is only one of Wikipedia's core content policies, which also include neutral point of view and no original research. These policies work together to determine whether information from reliable sources should be included or excluded.\n\nContents\n\n1 How to use this list\n\n1.1 What if my source isn't here?\n\n\n2 How to improve this list\n\n2.1 Inclusion criteria\n2.2 Instructions\n\n\n3 Legend\n4 Sources\n5 Categories\n\n5.1 Self-published peerage websites\n5.2 State-sponsored fake news sites\n5.3 Student media\n\n\n6 See also\n\n6.1 Topic-specific pages\n6.2 Templates and categories\n\n\n7 Notes\n8 References\n9 External links\n\n\nHow to use this list[edit]\nShortcutWP:RSPUSE\nRefer to the legend for definitions of the icons in the list, but note that the discussion summaries provide more specific guidance on sources than the icons in the \"Status\" column. When in doubt, defer to the linked discussions, which provide in-depth arguments on when it is appropriate to use a source. The list is not an independent document; it is derived from the conclusions of the referenced discussions and formal requests for comment (RfCs). This list indexes discussions that reflect community consensus, and is intended as a useful summary.\nContext matters tremendously when determining the reliability of sources, and their appropriate use on Wikipedia. Sources which are generally unreliable may still be useful in some situations. For example, even extremely low-quality sources, such as social media, may sometimes be used as self-published sources for routine information about the subject themselves. Conversely, some otherwise high-quality sources may not be reliable for highly technical subjects that fall well outside their normal areas of expertise, and even very high-quality sources may occasionally make errors, or retract pieces they have published in their entirety. Even considering content published by a single source, some may represent high-quality professional journalism, while other content may be merely opinion pieces, which mainly represent the personal views of the author, and depend on the author's personal reliability as a source. Be especially careful with sponsored content, because while it is usually unreliable as a source, it is designed to appear otherwise.\nConsider also the weight of the claims you are supporting, which should be evaluated alongside the reliability of the sources cited. Mundane, uncontroversial details have the lowest burden of proof, while information related to biomedicine and living persons have the highest.\n\nWhat if my source isn't here?[edit]\nShortcutWP:RSPMISSING\nDon't panic. If your source isn't listed here, the only thing it really means is that it hasn't been the subject of repeated community discussion. That may be because the source you want to use is a stellar source, and we simply never needed to talk about it because it was so obvious.[a] It could mean that the source covers a niche topic, or that it simply fell through the cracks. Or it could mean the source is so obviously poor it never merited discussion. If you're concerned about any source in particular, you should start a discussion about it at the reliable sources noticeboard (RSN), after checking the \"Search the noticeboard archives\" there first. That is, after all, how the entries on this list got here to begin with.\n\n\nA source's absence from the list does not imply that it is any more or less reliable than the sources that are present.\n\nHow to improve this list[edit]\nShortcutWP:RSPIMPROVE\nConsensus can change. If you believe that circumstances have evolved since the most recent discussion, new evidence has emerged that was not available at the time, or there is a new line of argument not previously covered, consider starting a discussion or a request for comment (RfC) at the reliable sources noticeboard.\nBefore doing so, please thoroughly familiarize yourself with content of previous discussions, and particularly the reasoning why consensus was reached, and not simply the outcome itself. Also consider when consensus was formed, and that the outcomes of very recent discussions are unlikely to be quickly overturned. Repeatedly restarting discussions where a strong and recent consensus already exists, may be considered disruptive and a type of forum shopping.\nIf you feel that this list inadequately summarizes the content of the linked discussions, please help to improve it, or start a discussion on the talk page, especially if your changes prove controversial. In updating this list, please be mindful that it should only summarize the content of past discussions, and should not include novel arguments not previously covered in a centralized forum. If you would like to present a novel argument or interpretation, please do so in one of these forums, so that the discussion may be linked to, and itself summarized here.\n\nInclusion criteria[edit]\nShortcutWP:RSPCRITERIA\nFor a source to be added to this list, editors generally expect two or more significant discussions about the source's reliability in the past, or an uninterrupted request for comment on the source's reliability that took place on the reliable sources noticeboard. For a discussion to be considered significant, most editors expect no fewer than two qualifying participants for RSN discussions where the source's name is in the section heading, and no fewer than three qualifying participants for all other discussions. Qualifying participants are editors who make at least one comment on the source's reliability.\n\nInstructions[edit]\nMain page: Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Perennial sources/Instructions\nAny editor may improve this list. Please refer to the instructions for details, and ask for help on the talk page if you get stuck.\n\nLegend[edit]\n\nShortcutWP:GREL Generally reliable in its areas of expertise: Editors show consensus that the source is reliable in most cases on subject matters in its areas of expertise. The source has a reputation for fact-checking, accuracy, and error-correction, often in the form of a strong editorial team. It will normally still be necessary to analyze how much weight to give the source and how to describe its statements. Arguments to exclude such a source entirely must be strong and convincing: e.g. the material is contradicted by more authoritative sources, it is outside the source's accepted areas of expertise (a well-established news organization is normally reliable for politics but not for philosophy), a specific subcategory of the source is less reliable (such as opinion pieces in a newspaper), the source is making an exceptional claim, or a higher standard of sourcing is required (WP:MEDRS, WP:BLP) for the statement in question.\nShortcutWP:MREL No consensus, unclear, or additional considerations apply: The source is marginally reliable (i.e. neither generally reliable nor generally unreliable), and may be usable depending on context. Editors may not have been able to agree on whether the source is appropriate, or may have agreed that it is only reliable in certain circumstances. It may be necessary to evaluate each use of the source on a case-by-case basis while accounting for specific factors unique to the source in question. Carefully review the Summary column of the table for details on the status of the source and the factors that should be considered.\nShortcutWP:GUNREL Generally unreliable: Editors show consensus that the source is questionable in most cases. The source may lack an editorial team, have a poor reputation for fact-checking, fail to correct errors, be self-published, or present user-generated content. Outside exceptional circumstances, the source should normally not be used, and it should never be used for information about a living person. Even in cases where the source may be valid, it is usually better to find a more reliable source instead. If no such source exists, that may suggest that the information is inaccurate. The source may still be used for uncontroversial self-descriptions, and self-published or user-generated content authored by established subject-matter experts is also acceptable.\nShortcutWP:DEPREC Deprecated: There is community consensus from a request for comment to deprecate the source. The source is considered generally unreliable, and use of the source is generally prohibited. Despite this, the source may be used for uncontroversial self-descriptions, although reliable secondary sources are still preferred. An edit filter, 869 (hist\u00a0\u00b7 log), may be in place to warn editors who attempt to cite the source as a reference in articles. The warning message can be dismissed. Edits that trigger the filter are tagged.\n Blacklisted: Due to persistent abuse, usually in the form of external link spamming, the source is on the spam blacklist or the Wikimedia global spam blacklist. External links to this source are blocked, unless an exception is made for a specific link in the spam whitelist.\n Request for comment: The linked discussion is an uninterrupted request for comment on the reliable sources noticeboard or another centralized venue suitable for determining the source's reliability. The closing statement of any RfC that is not clearly outdated should normally be considered authoritative and can only be overturned by a newer RfC.\n Stale discussions: The source has not been discussed on the reliable sources noticeboard for four calendar years, and the consensus may have changed since the most recent discussion. However, sources that are considered generally unreliable for being self-published or presenting user-generated content are excluded. A change in consensus resulting from changes in the source itself does not apply to publications of the source from before the changes in question. Additionally, while it may be prudent to review these sources before using them, editors should generally assume that the source's previous status is still in effect if there is no reason to believe that the circumstances have changed.\n Discussion in progress: The source is currently being discussed on the reliable sources noticeboard. Italic numbers represent active discussions (all discussions that are not closed or archived) on the reliable sources noticeboard. Letters represent discussions outside of the reliable sources noticeboard.\n\ud83d\udccc Shortcut: Abbreviated wikilink to the list entry for the source.\n\nSources[edit]\nShortcutsWP:RSPSOURCESWP:RSPSRCWP:RSPSS\nNote: If you add/remove a source in the \"generally unreliable\", \"deprecated\" or \"blacklisted\" categories, please update WP:CITEWATCH/SETUP/GENERAL \u00a7\u00a0WP:RSP, or leave a note at Wikipedia talk:CITEWATCH if you need help.\n\n\nContents\n\n0\u20139\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\nJ\nK\nL\nM\nN\nO\nP\nQ\nR\nS\nT\nU\nV\nW\nX\nY\nZ\nLegend  \n\n\nPerennial sources\n\n\nSource\n\nStatus(legend)\n\nDiscussions\n\nUses\n\n\nList\n\nLast\n\nSummary\n\n\n112 Ukraine\n\n\n\n\u00a02019 \u00a02020 \u00a02020\n1\nA B\n\n\n2020\n\n112 Ukraine was deprecated following a 2019 RfC, which showed overwhelming consensus for the deprecation of a slew of sources associated with Russian disinformation in Ukraine. It was pointed out later in a 2020 RfC that 112 Ukraine had not been explicitly discussed in that first discussion prior to its blacklisting request. Further discussion established a rough consensus that the source is generally unreliable, but did not form a consensus for deprecation or blacklisting. The prior blacklisting was reversed as out of process.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAd Fontes Media\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n2020\n\nThere is consensus that Ad Fontes Media and their Media Bias Chart should not be used in article space in reference to sources' political leaning or reliability. Editors consider it a self-published source and have questioned its methodology.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAdvameg (City-Data)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a02019 \u00a02019 \u00a02019\n+14[b]\n\n\n2019\n\nAdvameg operates content farms, including City-Data, that use scraped or improperly licensed content. These sites frequently republish content from Gale's encyclopedias; many editors can obtain access to Gale through The Wikipedia Library free of charge. Advameg's sites are on the Wikipedia spam blacklist, and links must be whitelisted before they can be used.  WP:COPYLINK prohibits linking to copyright violations.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0 +43\n\n\nAgence France-Presse (AFP)\n\n\n\n1 2\n\n2020\n\nAgence France-Presse is a news agency. There is consensus that Agence France-Presse is generally reliable. Syndicated reports from Agence France-Presse that are published in other sources are also considered generally reliable.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAl Jazeera (Al Jazeera English, Aljazeera.com)\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n2019\n\nAl Jazeera is considered a generally reliable news organization. Editors perceive Al Jazeera English (and Aljazeera.com) to be more reliable than Al Jazeera's Arabic-language news reporting. Some editors say that Al Jazeera, particularly its Arabic-language media, is a partisan source with respect to the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict. Al Jazeera's news blogs should be handled with the corresponding policy.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAllGov.com\n\n\n\n1 2\n\n2018\n\nThere is consensus that AllGov is generally unreliable due to its inclusion of volunteer-contributed content.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAlterNet\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n2019\n\nThere is consensus that AlterNet is generally unreliable. Editors consider AlterNet a partisan source, and its statements should be attributed. AlterNet's syndicated content should be evaluated by the reliability of its original publisher, and the citation should preferably point to the original publisher.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAmazon WP:RSPAMAZON\u00a0\ud83d\udccc\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n2021\n\nUser reviews on Amazon are anonymous, self-published, and unverifiable, and should not be used at all. Amazon is a reliable source for basic information about a work (such as release date, ISBN, etc.), although it is unnecessary to cite Amazon when the work itself may serve as a source for that information (e.g., authors' names and ISBNs). Future release dates may be unreliable.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a03\u00a0\u00a04\u00a0\u00a05\u00a0\u00a06\u00a0\u00a07\u00a0\u00a08\u00a0\u00a09\u00a0\u00a010\u00a0\u00a011\u00a0\u00a012\u00a0\u00a013\u00a0\u00a014\u00a0\u00a015\u00a0\u00a016\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe American Conservative (TAC)\n\n\n\n\u00a02019 \u00a02020 \u00a02021\n1\n\n\n2021\n\nThere is consensus that The American Conservative is a usable source for attributed opinions. As TAC is published by the American Ideas Institute, an advocacy organization, TAC is considered biased or opinionated.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAn Phoblacht\n\n\n\n\u00a02020\n1\n\n\n2020\n\nThere is consensus that An Phoblacht is generally unreliable for news reporting, as it is a publication of Sinn F\u00e9in. Under the conditions of WP:ABOUTSELF, An Phoblacht is usable for attributed statements from Sinn F\u00e9in and some editors believe that the publication may also be used for attributed statements from the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA).\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n Anadolu Agency (general topics) (AA)\n\n\n\n\u00a02019\n\n2019\n\nThe 2019 RfC established no consensus on the reliability of Anadolu Agency. Well-established news outlets are normally considered reliable for statements of fact. However, Anadolu Agency is frequently described as a mouthpiece of the Turkish government that engages in propaganda, owing to its state-run status. See also: Anadolu Agency (controversial topics, international politics).\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAnadolu Agency (controversial topics, international politics) (AA)\n\n\n\n\u00a02019\n\n2019\n\nIn the 2019 RfC, editors generally agreed that Anadolu Agency is generally unreliable for topics that are controversial or related to international politics. See also: Anadolu Agency (general topics).\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAncestry.com WP:ANCESTRY.COM\u00a0\ud83d\udccc\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n2021\n\nAncestry.com is a genealogy site that hosts a database of primary source documents including marriage and census records. Some of these sources may be usable under WP:BLPPRIMARY, but secondary sources, where available, are usually preferred. Ancestry.com also hosts user-generated content, which is unreliable.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAnswers.com (WikiAnswers)\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n2010\n\nAnswers.com (previously known as WikiAnswers) is a Q&A site that incorporates user-generated content. In the past, Answers.com republished excerpts and summaries of tertiary sources, including D&B Hoovers, Gale, and HighBeam Research. Citations of republished content on Answers.com should point to the original source, with a note that the source was accessed \"via Answers.com\". Answers.com also previously served as a Wikipedia mirror; using republished Wikipedia content is considered circular sourcing.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAnti-Defamation League (ADL)\n\n\n\n\u00a02020\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n\n2021\n\nThere is consensus that ADL is a generally reliable source, including for topics related to hate groups and extremism in the U.S. There is no consensus that ADL must be attributed in all cases, but there is consensus that the labelling of organisations and individuals by the ADL (particularly as antisemitic) should be attributed. Some editors consider the ADL's opinion pieces not reliable, and that they should only be used with attribution. Some editors consider the ADL a biased source for Israel/Palestine related topics that should be used with caution, if at all.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nApple Daily\n\n\n\n\u00a02020\n\n2020\n\nThe consensus is that Apple Daily is often but not always reliable, and that it may be appropriate to use it in articles about Hong Kong, but subject to editorial judgment, particularly if the topic is controversial and/or Apple Daily is the only source for a contested claim. There is concern that historically, it was not necessarily as reliable as it is today.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAsian News International (ANI)\n\n\n\n\u00a02021\n\n2021\n\nAsian News International is an Indian news agency. For general reporting, Asian News International is considered to be between marginally reliable and generally unreliable, with consensus that it is biased and that it should be attributed in-text for contentious claims. For its coverage related to Indian domestic politics, foreign politics, and other topics in which the Government of India may have an established stake, there is consensus that Asian News International is questionable and generally unreliable due to its reported dissemination of pro-government propaganda.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nArab News\n\n\n\n\u00a02020\n1 2 3\n\n\n2020\n\nThere is consensus that Arab News is a usable source for topics unrelated to the Saudi Arabian government. As Arab News is closely associated with the Saudi Arabian government and is published in a country with low press freedom, editors consider Arab News biased and non-independent for Saudi Arabian politics, and recommend attribution for its coverage in this area. Some editors consider Arab News unreliable for matters related to the Saudi Arabian government.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nArs Technica\n\n\n\n1 2\n\n2012\n\nArs Technica is considered generally reliable for science- and technology-related articles.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\narXiv\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4\nA B\n\n\n2015\n\narXiv is a preprint (and sometimes postprint) repository containing papers that have undergone moderation, but not necessarily peer review. There is consensus that arXiv is a self-published source, and is generally unreliable with the exception of papers authored by established subject-matter experts. Verify whether a paper on arXiv is also published in a peer-reviewed academic journal; in these cases, cite the more reliable journal and provide an open access link to the paper (which may be hosted on arXiv).\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAskMen\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n2020\n\nThere is no consensus on the reliability of AskMen. See also: IGN.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAssociated Press (AP)\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n2018\n\nThe Associated Press is a news agency. There is consensus that the Associated Press is generally reliable. Syndicated reports from the Associated Press that are published in other sources are also considered generally reliable.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe Atlantic (The Atlantic Monthly)\n\n\n\n1 2 3\n\n2019\n\nThe Atlantic is considered generally reliable.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe Australian\n\n\n\n1 2\n\n2020\n\nThe Australian is considered generally reliable. Some editors consider The Australian to be a partisan source. Opinion pieces are covered by WP:RSOPINION and WP:NEWSBLOG. Several editors expressed concern regarding their coverage of climate change related topics.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe A.V. Club\n\n\n\n1 2 3\nA\n\n\n2014\n\nThe A.V. Club is considered generally reliable for film, music and TV reviews.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAxios\n\n\n\n1 2\n\n2020\n\nThere is consensus that Axios is generally reliable. Some editors consider Axios to be a biased or opinionated source. Statements of opinion should be attributed and evaluated for due weight.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBaidu Baike\n\n\n\n\u00a02020\n1 2 3 4\n\n\n2020\n\nBaidu Baike was deprecated in the 2020 RfC as it is similar to an open wiki, which is a type of self-published source. Although edits are reviewed by Baidu administrators before they are published, most editors believe the editorial standards of Baidu Baike to be very low, and do not see any evidence of fact-checking. The Baidu 10 Mythical Creatures kuso originated from Baidu Baike.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBallotpedia\n\n\n\n1 2 3\n\n2016\n\nThere is no consensus on the reliability of Ballotpedia. The site has an editorial team and accepts error corrections, but some editors do not express strong confidence in the site's editorial process. Discussions indicate that Ballotpedia used to be an open wiki, but stopped accepting user-generated content at some point. Currently, the site claims: \"Ballotpedia's articles are 100 percent written by our professional staff of more than 50 writers and researchers.\"[1]\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBBC (British Broadcasting Corporation)\n\n\n\n16[c]\n\n2020\n\nBBC is considered generally reliable. This includes BBC News, BBC documentaries, and the BBC History site (on BBC Online). However, this excludes BBC projects that incorporate user-generated content (such as h2g2 and the BBC Domesday Project) and BBC publications with reduced editorial oversight (such as Collective). Statements of opinion should conform to the corresponding guideline.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBellingcat\n\n\n\n\u00a02019\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n\n2021\n\nThere is consensus that Bellingcat is generally reliable for news and should preferably be used with attribution. Some editors consider Bellingcat a biased source, as it receives funding from the National Endowment for Democracy.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nbestgore.com\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a02021\n\n2021\n\nThere is consensus that bestgore.com is a shock site with no credibility. It is deprecated and has been added to the spam blacklist.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBild WP:BILD\u00a0\ud83d\udccc\n\n\n\n1 2 3\n\n2020\n\nBild is a German tabloid that has been unfavourably compared to The Sun. A few editors consider the source usable in some cases.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBiography.com\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n2018\n\nThere is no consensus on the reliability of Biography.com. Some editors consider the source reliable because of its backing from A&E Networks and references to the website in news media. Others point to discrepancies between information on Biography.com and on more established sources, and an unclear fact-checking process.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBlaze Media (BlazeTV, Conservative Review, CRTV, TheBlaze)\n\n\n\n1 2 3\n\n2018\n\nBlaze Media (including TheBlaze) is considered generally unreliable for facts. In some cases, it may be usable for attributed opinions. In 2018, TheBlaze merged with Conservative Review (CRTV) to form Blaze Media.[2]\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBlogger (blogspot.com)\n\n\n\n21[d]\n\n2020\n\nBlogger is a blog hosting service that owns the blogspot.com domain. As a self-published source, it is considered generally unreliable and should be avoided unless the author is a subject-matter expert or the blog is used for uncontroversial self-descriptions. Blogger blogs published by a media organization should be evaluated by the reliability of the organization. Newspaper blogs hosted using Blogger should be handled with WP:NEWSBLOG. Blogger should never be used for third-party claims related to living persons; this includes interviews, as even those cannot be authenticated.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBloomberg (Bloomberg News, Bloomberg Businessweek)\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n2019\n\nBloomberg publications, including Bloomberg News and Bloomberg Businessweek, are considered generally reliable for news and business topics. See also: Bloomberg profiles.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBloomberg profiles\n\n\n\n1 2\n\n2018\n\nBloomberg company and executive profiles are generally considered to be based on company press releases and should only be used as a source for uncontroversial information. There is consensus that these profiles should not be used to establish notability. Some editors consider these profiles to be akin to self-published sources. See also: Bloomberg.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBoing Boing\n\n\n\n1 2 3\n\n2019\n\nThere is no consensus on the reliability of Boing Boing. Although Boing Boing is a group blog, some of its articles are written by subject-matter experts such as Cory Doctorow, who is considered generally reliable for copyright law.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBreitbart News WP:BREITBART\u00a0\ud83d\udccc\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a02018 \u00a02018\n+15[e]\n\n\n2020\n\nDue to persistent abuse, Breitbart News is on the Wikipedia spam blacklist, and links must be whitelisted before they can be used. The site has published a number of falsehoods, conspiracy theories, and intentionally misleading stories. The 2018 RfC showed a very clear consensus that Breitbart News should be deprecated in the same way as the Daily Mail. This does not mean Breitbart News can no longer be used, but it should not be used, ever, as a reference for facts, due to its unreliability. It can still be used as a primary source when attributing opinions, viewpoints, and commentary. Breitbart News has directly attacked and doxed Wikipedia editors.

A 2014 study from the Pew Research Center found BuzzFeed to be the least trusted news source in America.[3] BuzzFeed may use A/B testing for new articles, which may cause article content to change.[4] BuzzFeed operates a separate news division, BuzzFeed News, which has higher editorial standards and is now hosted on a different website.

BuzzFeed News now operates separately from BuzzFeed, and most news content originally hosted on BuzzFeed was moved to the BuzzFeed News website in 2018.[5] In light of the staff layoffs at BuzzFeed in January 2019, some editors recommend exercising  more caution for BuzzFeed News articles published after this date. The site's opinion pieces should be handled with WP:RSOPINION.

Some editors consider the Cato Institute an authoritative source on libertarianism in the United States. There is no consensus on whether it is generally reliable on other topics. Most editors consider the Cato Institute biased or opinionated, so its uses should be attributed.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCelebrityNetWorth\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n2018\n\nThere is consensus that CelebrityNetWorth is generally unreliable.

Though its articles are regularly written by subject-matter experts in economics and are frequently cited by reliable sources, most editors consider the CEPR biased or opinionated, so its uses should be attributed.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCentre for Research on Globalization (CRG, Global Research, globalresearch.ca)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a02019\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\n2019\n\nDue to persistent abuse, Global Research is on the Wikipedia spam blacklist, and links must be whitelisted before they can be used. The Centre for Research on Globalization is the organization that operates the Global Research website (globalresearch.ca, not to be confused with GlobalSecurity.org). The CRG is considered generally unreliable due to its propagation of conspiracy theories and lack of editorial oversight. It is biased or opinionated, and its content is likely to constitute undue weight. As it often covers fringe material, parity of sources should be considered.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a03\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCESNUR (Center for Studies on New Religions, Centro Studi sulle Nuove Religioni)\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n2019\n\nCESNUR is an apologia site for new religious movements, and thus is inherently unreliable in its core area due to conflicts of interest.

The 2021 RfC found narrow consensus against deprecating China Daily, owing to the lack of available usable sources for Chinese topics. There is consensus that China Daily may be used, cautiously and with good editorial judgment, as a source for the position of the Chinese authorities and the Chinese Communist Party; as a source for the position of China Daily itself; as a source for facts about non-political events in mainland China, while noting that (a) China Daily's interpretation of those facts is likely to contain political spin, and (b) China Daily's omission of details from a story should not be used to determine that such details are untruthful; and, with great caution, as a supplementary (but not sole) source for facts about political events of mainland China. Editors agree that when using this source, context matters a great deal and the facts should be separated from China Daily's view about those facts. It is best practice to use in-text attribution and inline citations when sourcing content to China Daily.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a03\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nChina Global Television Network (CGTN, CCTV International) WP:CGTN\u00a0\ud83d\udccc\n\n\n\n\u00a02020\n1 2\n\n\n2020\n\nChina Global Television Network was deprecated in the 2020 RfC for publishing false or fabricated information.

It discloses its methodologies, is certified by the International Fact-Checking Network, and has been endorsed by other reliable sources. Most editors do not consider Climate Feedback a self-published source due to its high reviewer requirements.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCNET (Computer Network)\n\n\n\n16[h]\n\n2015\n\nCNET is considered generally reliable for technology-related articles.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCNN (Cable News Network)\n\n\n\n\u00a02019 \u00a02020\n13[i]\n\n\n2021\n\nThere is consensus that news broadcast or published by CNN is generally reliable. However, iReport consists solely of user-generated content, and talk show content should be treated as opinion pieces.

A few editors consider Coda Media a biased source for international politics related to the US, as it has received funding from the National Endowment for Democracy, though not to the extent that it affects reliability.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCoinDesk\n\n\n\n\u00a02018 \u00a02019\n1 2 3\n\n\n2019\n\nThere is consensus that CoinDesk should not be used to establish notability for article topics, and that it should be avoided in favor of more mainstream sources. Check CoinDesk articles for conflict of interest disclosures, and verify whether their parent company (Digital Currency Group) has an ownership stake in a company covered by CoinDesk.[7]\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCommon Sense Media (CSM) WP:CSM\u00a0\ud83d\udccc\n\n\n\n1 2 3\n\n2020\n\nThere is consensus that Common Sense Media is generally reliable for entertainment reviews.

There is consensus that the Daily Mail (including its online version, MailOnline) is generally unreliable, and its use as a reference is generally prohibited, especially when other more reliable sources exist. As a result, the Daily Mail should not be used for determining notability, nor should it be used as a source in articles. The Daily Mail may be used in rare cases in an about-self fashion. Some editors regard the Daily Mail as reliable historically, so old articles may be used in a historical context. (Note that dailymail.co.uk is not trustworthy as a source of past content that was printed in the Daily Mail.) The restriction is often incorrectly interpreted as a \"ban\" on the Daily Mail. The UK Daily Mail is not to be confused with other publications named Daily Mail. The dailymail.com domain was previously used by the unaffiliated Charleston Daily Mail, and reference links are still present.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a03\u00a0\u00a04\u00a0\u00a05\u00a0\u00a06\u00a0\u00a07\u00a0\u00a08\u00a0\u00a09\u00a0\u00a010\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nDaily Mirror (Mirror) WP:DAILYMIRROR\u00a0\ud83d\udccc\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n2020\n\nThe Daily Mirror is a tabloid newspaper that publishes tabloid journalism.

From 2009 to 2010, the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online accepted a small number of content submissions from the general public.

However, especially for objects like boundaries (of neighborhoods, allotments, etc.), where other reliable sources are available they should be treated preferentially to Google Maps and Google Street View. It can also be difficult or impossible to determine the veracity of past citations, since Google Maps data is not publicly archived, and may be removed or replaced as soon as it is not current. Inferring information solely from Street View pictures may be considered original research. Note that due to restrictions on geographic data in China, OpenStreetMap coordinates for places in mainland China are almost always much more accurate than Google's \u2013 despite OpenStreetMap being user-generated \u2013 due to the severe distortion introduced by most commercial map providers.

In 2011, Newsweek was a reputable magazine with only some minor problems while it was owned by The Newsweek Daily Beast Company (which also owned The Daily Beast). Blogs under Newsweek, including The Gaggle, should be handled with the WP:NEWSBLOG policy.

From 2013 to 2018, Newsweek was owned and operated by IBT Media, the parent company of International Business Times. IBT Media introduced a number of bad practices to the once reputable magazine and mainly focused on clickbait headlines over quality journalism. Its current relationship with IBT Media is unclear, and Newsweek's quality has not returned to its status prior to the 2013 purchase. Many editors have noted that there are several exceptions to this standard, so consensus is to evaluate Newsweek content on a case-by-case basis.

It was deprecated in the 2019 RfC. Editors note NNDB's poor reputation for fact-checking and accuracy, despite the site claiming to have an editorial process. Editors have also found instances of NNDB incorporating content from Wikipedia, which would make the use of the affected pages circular sourcing.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNPR (National Public Radio)\n\n\n\n1 2 3\n\n2020\n\nThere is consensus that NPR is generally reliable for news and statements of fact.

As with Breitbart News, this does not mean it cannot ever be used on Wikipedia; it means it cannot be used as a reference for facts. It can still be used as a primary source for attributing opinions, viewpoints, and the like.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOne America News Network (OANN) WP:OANN\u00a0\ud83d\udccc\n\n\n\n\u00a02019\n1\n\n\n2019\n\nIn the 2019 RfC, there was clear consensus to deprecate One America News Network as a source \u00e0 la the Daily Mail. Editors noted that One America News Network published a number of falsehoods, conspiracy theories, and intentionally misleading stories. One America News Network should not be used, ever, as a reference for facts, due to its unreliability. It can still be used as a primary source when attributing opinions, viewpoints, and commentary, meaning that it should not be used as a source outside of its own article.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe Onion\n\n\n\n1 2\n\n2019\n\nThe Onion is a satirical news website, and should not be used as a source for facts.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOpIndia WP:OPINDIA\u00a0\ud83d\udccc\n\n\u00a0\n\n1 2\n\n2020\n\nDue to persistent abuse, OpIndia is on the Wikipedia spam blacklist, and links must be whitelisted before they can be used. OpIndia is considered generally unreliable due to its poor reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. OpIndia was rejected by the International Fact-Checking Network when it applied for accreditation in 2019. In the 2020 discussion, most editors expressed support for deprecating OpIndia. Editors consider the site biased or opinionated. OpIndia has directly attacked and doxed Wikipedia editors who edit India-related articles.

Some articles may be used for uncontroversial claims about the article's author.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nPress TV\n\n\n\n\u00a02020\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n\n2020\n\nThere is consensus that Press TV is generally unreliable. As a state-owned media network in a country with low press freedom, Press TV may be a primary source for the viewpoint of the Iranian government, although due weight should be considered. Press TV is biased or opinionated, and its statements should be attributed. Press TV is particularly known for promoting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, including Holocaust denial.[17]\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nPride.com\n\n\n\n\u00a02020\n\n2020\n\nThere is consensus that Pride.com is marginally reliable and that its articles should be evaluated for reliability on a case-by-case basis. Editors consider Pride.com comparable to BuzzFeed in its presentation.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nProject Veritas WP:VERITAS\u00a0\ud83d\udccc\n\n\n\n1 2\n\n2020\n\nThere is consensus that Project Veritas is generally unreliable due to its reputation for selectively editing its videos. As an activist group, Project Veritas is a biased or opinionated source.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nProPublica\n\n\n\n\u00a02019\n1\n\n\n2019\n\nThere is a strong consensus that ProPublica is generally reliable for all purposes because it has an excellent reputation for fact-checking and accuracy, is widely cited by reliable sources, and has received multiple Pulitzer Prizes.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nQuackwatch\n\n\n\n\u00a02019\n+13[af]\n\n\n2019\n\nArticles written by Stephen Barrett on Quackwatch are considered generally reliable (as Barrett is a subject-matter expert) and self-published (as there is disagreement on the comprehensiveness of Quackwatch's editorial process); Barrett's articles should not be used as a source of information on other living persons. Articles written by other authors on Quackwatch are not considered self-published. Many editors believe uses of Quackwatch should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and some editors say its statements should be attributed. It may be preferable to use the sources cited by Quackwatch instead of Quackwatch itself. Since it often covers fringe material, parity of sources should be considered.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nQuadrant\n\n\n\n\u00a02019\n\n2019\n\nMost editors consider Quadrant generally unreliable for factual reporting.

Quillette is primarily a publication of opinion, and thus actual usage in articles will usually be a question of whether or not it is WP:DUE for an attributed opinion rather than whether it is reliable for a factual claim.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nQuora\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n2019\n\nQuora is a Q&A site. As an Internet forum, it is a self-published source that incorporates user-generated content, and is considered generally unreliable. Posts from verified accounts on Quora can be used as primary sources for statements about themselves. Posts from verified accounts of established experts may also be used to substantiate statements in their field of expertise, in accordance with the policy on self-published sources.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nRadio Free Asia (RFA)\n\n\n\n\u00a02021\n1 2\n\n\n2021\n\nRadio Free Asia can be generally considered a reliable source. In particularly geopolitically-charged areas, attribution of its point of view and funding by the U.S. government may be appropriate. Per the result of a 2021 RfC, editors have established that there is little reason to think RFA demonstrates some systematic inaccuracy, unreliability, or level of government co-option that precludes its use.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nRappler WP:RAPPLER\u00a0\ud83d\udccc\n\n\n\n1 2 3\n\n2018\n\nThere is consensus that staff content by Rappler is generally reliable. The IMHO section consists of opinions by readers, and not by paid staff. The defunct x.rappler.com section functioned as a self-published blogging service, and is therefore considered generally unreliable.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nRate Your Music (RYM, Cinemos, Glitchwave, Sonemic)\n\n\n\n\u00a02019\n1\nA\n\n\n2019\n\nRate Your Music was deprecated in the 2019 RfC.

Editors almost unanimously agree that the source is biased and that in-text attribution should accompany each use of the source.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nRealClearPolitics (RCP, RealClearInvestigations)\n\n\n\n1 2\n\n2021\n\nThere is no consensus as to RealClearPolitics's reliability. They appear to have the trappings of a reliable source, but their tactics in news reporting suggest they may be publishing non-factual or misleading information. Use as a source in a Wikipedia article should probably only be done with caution, and better yet should be avoided.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nReason\n\n\n\n1 2\n\n2020\n\nThere is consensus that Reason is generally reliable for news and facts. Editors consider Reason to be a biased or opinionated source that primarily publishes commentary, analysis, and opinion articles. Statements of opinion should be attributed and evaluated for due weight.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n2020\n\nReddit is a social news and discussion website. Reddit contains mostly user-generated content, and is considered both self-published and generally unreliable. Interview responses written by verified interviewees on the r/IAmA subreddit are primary sources, and editors disagree on their reliability. The policy on the use of sources about themselves applies.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nRedState\n\n\n\n1 2\n\n2020\n\nThere is consensus that RedState should not be used as a source of facts.

ResearchGate does not perform fact checking or peer reviewing, and is considered a self-published source. Verify whether a paper on ResearchGate is also published in a peer-reviewed academic journal; in these cases, cite the more reliable journal and provide an open access link to the paper (which may be hosted on ResearchGate).\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nRepublic TV\n\n\n\n1 2\n\n2020\n\nRepublic TV was criticized for spreading misinformation about COVID-19, the Love Jihad conspiracy theory, and other fabrications and factually incorrect information.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nReuters\n\n\n\n1 2 3\n\n2018\n\nReuters is a news agency.

There is consensus that RhythmOne websites are usable for entertainment reviews with attribution. Some editors question the accuracy of these websites for biographical details and recommend more reliable sources when available. Editors also advise against using AllMusic's genre classifications from the website's sidebar. Listings without accompanying prose do not count toward notability.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a03\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nRIA Novosti\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n2016\n\nRIA Novosti was an official news agency of the Russian government.

Rolling Stone's opinion pieces and reviews, as well as any contentious statements regarding living persons, should only be used with attribution. The publication's capsule reviews deserve less weight than their full-length reviews, as they are subject to a lower standard of fact-checking. Some editors say that Rolling Stone is a partisan source in the field of politics, and that their statements in this field should also be attributed.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nRotten Tomatoes\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4\nA B C\n\n\n2015\n\nRotten Tomatoes is considered generally reliable for its review aggregation and its news articles on film and TV. There is no consensus on whether its blog articles and critic opinion pages are generally reliable for facts. There is consensus that user reviews on Rotten Tomatoes are generally unreliable, as they are self-published sources.

Editors do not consider Science-Based Medicine a self-published source, but it is also not a peer-reviewed publication with respect to WP:MEDRS.

There is no consensus on the reliability of ScienceBlogs articles in general. Most editors consider ScienceBlogs articles written by subject-matter experts reliable, though articles outside the writer's relevant field are not. As a self-published source it should not be used as a source of information on other living persons. Since it often covers fringe material, parity of sources may be relevant.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nScientific American (SA, SciAm)\n\n\n\n1 2\n\n2020\n\nScientific American is considered generally reliable for popular science content.

It is considered generally unreliable, especially for biographies of living persons. Anyone can upload any document they'd like and there is no assurance that it hasn't been manipulated. Many documents on Scribd's self-publishing platform violate copyrights, so linking to them from Wikipedia would also violate the WP:COPYVIOEL guideline and the WP:COPYVIO policy.

As an advocacy group, the SPLC is a biased and opinionated source. The organization's views, especially when labeling hate groups, should be attributed per WP:RSOPINION. Take care to ensure that content from the SPLC constitutes due weight in the article and conforms to the biographies of living persons policy. Some editors have questioned the reliability of the SPLC on non-United States topics. SPLC classifications should not automatically be included in the lead section of the article about the group which received the classification.

Swarajya is considered generally unreliable due to its poor reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. In the 2020 discussion, most editors expressed support for deprecating Swarajya.

TechCrunch may be useful for satisfying verifiability, but may be less useful for the purpose of determining notability.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTelesur\n\n\n\n\u00a02019\n1 2\n\n\n2019\n\nTelesur was deprecated in the 2019 RfC, which showed consensus that the TV channel is a Bolivarian propaganda outlet. Many editors state that Telesur publishes false information. As a state-owned media network in a country with low press freedom, Telesur may be a primary source for the viewpoint of the Venezuelan government, although due weight should be considered. Telesur is biased or opinionated, and its statements should be attributed.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTheWrap\n\n\n\n1 2\n\n2017\n\nAs an industry trade publication, there is consensus that TheWrap is a good source for entertainment news and media analysis.

Although TMZ is cited by reliable sources, most editors consider TMZ a low-quality source and prefer more reliable sources when available. Because TMZ frequently publishes articles on rumors and speculation without named authors, it is recommended to attribute statements from TMZ. When TMZ is the only source for a piece of information, consider whether the information constitutes due or undue weight, especially when the subject is a living person.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTorrentFreak (TF)\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n2019\n\nMost editors consider TorrentFreak generally reliable on topics involving file sharing.

As a self-published source, it is considered generally unreliable and should be avoided unless the author is a subject-matter expert or the tweet is used for an uncontroversial self-description. In most cases, Twitter accounts should only be cited if they are verified accounts or if the user's identity is confirmed in some way. Tweets that are not covered by reliable sources are likely to constitute undue weight.

The site consists mainly of news articles that qualify as user-generated content. In addition, editors heavily criticize VGChartz for poor accuracy standards in its video game sales data, and its methodology page consists of wholly unverified claims.[19] If other reliable sources publish video game sales data for certain regions (usually The NPD Group, Chart-Track, and/or Media Create), it is strongly advised that editors cite those sources instead.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nVice Media (Garage, i-D, Refinery29, Vice, Vice News, Motherboard)\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n2021\n\nThere is no consensus on the reliability of Vice Media publications.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a03\u00a0\u00a04\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nVogue\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n2018\n\nVogue is considered generally reliable.

Most editors agree that it is a partisan source. Some editors noted a history of publishing inaccurate or false information, of being slow to issue retractions or corrections, and of sometimes only doing so under the threat of legal action; a considerable minority favored deprecation on these grounds. The Washington Times is probably suitable for its mundane political coverage, although better sources should be preferred when available. The Washington Times should generally not be used for contentious claims, especially about living persons. A majority of editors regard the The Washington Times as generally reliable for topics other than politics and science. Opinion columns are governed by WP:RSOPINION and WP:NEWSBLOG.

For example, more than two million external links from Wikidata are shown through the {{Authority control}} template. There has been controversy over the use of Wikidata in the English Wikipedia due to its infancy, its vandalism issues and its sourcing. While there is no consensus on whether information from Wikidata should be used at all, there is general agreement that any Wikidata statements transcluded need to be just as \u2013 or more \u2013 reliable compared to Wikipedia content. As such, Module:WikidataIB and some related modules and templates filter unsourced Wikidata statements by default; however, other modules and templates, such as Module:Wikidata, do not. See also: Wikidata (direct citations).\n\n\u2014\n\n\nWikiLeaks\n\n\n\n13[ap]\n\n2020\n\nWikiLeaks is a repository of primary source documents leaked by anonymous sources. Some editors believe that documents from WikiLeaks fail the verifiability policy, because WikiLeaks does not adequately authenticate them, and there are concerns regarding whether the documents are genuine or tampered. It may be appropriate to cite a document from WikiLeaks as a primary source, but only if it is discussed by a reliable source. However, linking to material that violates copyright is prohibited by WP:COPYLINK.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWikinews\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n2012\n\nMost editors believe that Wikinews articles do not meet Wikipedia's verifiability standards. As Wikinews does not enforce a strong editorial policy, many editors consider the site equivalent to a self-published source, which is generally unreliable.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWikipedia (The Signpost)WP:RSPWP\u00a0\ud83d\udccc\n\n\n\n+19[aq]\n\n2020\n\nWikipedia is not a reliable source because open wikis are self-published sources. This includes articles, non-article pages, The Signpost, non-English Wikipedias, Wikipedia Books, and Wikipedia mirrors; see WP:CIRCULAR for guidance.[20] Occasionally, inexperienced editors may unintentionally cite the Wikipedia article about a publication instead of the publication itself; in these cases, fix the citation instead of removing it. Although citing Wikipedia as a source is against policy, content can be copied between articles with proper attribution; see WP:COPYWITHIN for instructions.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWired (Wired UK)\n\n\n\n+10[ar]\n\n2018\n\nWired magazine is considered generally reliable for science and technology.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWordPress.com\n\n\n\n14[as]\n\n2020\n\nWordPress.com is a blog hosting service that runs on the WordPress software. As a self-published source, it is considered generally unreliable and should be avoided unless the author is a subject-matter expert or the blog is used for uncontroversial self-descriptions. WordPress.com should never be used for claims related to living persons; this includes interviews, as even those cannot be authenticated.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWorldNetDaily (WND)WP:WND\u00a0\ud83d\udccc\n\n\n\n\u00a02018\n16[at]\n\n\n2018\n\nWorldNetDaily was deprecated in the 2018 RfC. There is clear consensus that WorldNetDaily is not a reliable source, and that it should not be used because of its particularly poor reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. The website is known for promoting falsehoods and conspiracy theories. Most editors consider WorldNetDaily a partisan source. WorldNetDaily's syndicated content should be evaluated by the reliability of its original publisher, and the citation should preferably point to the original publisher.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWorldometer (Worldometers)\n\n\n\n1 2 3\n\n2020\n\nWorldometer is a self-published source and editors have questioned its accuracy and methodology. It is disallowed by WikiProject COVID-19 as a source for statistics on the COVID-19 pandemic and is considered generally unreliable for other topics.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nXinhua News Agency (New China News Agency) WP:XINHUA\u00a0\ud83d\udccc\n\n\n\n\u00a02020\n1 2 3\n\n\n2021\n\nXinhua News Agency is the official state-run press agency of the People's Republic of China. There is consensus that Xinhua is generally reliable for factual reporting except in areas where the government of China may have a reason to use it for propaganda or disinformation. Xinhua is also generally reliable for the views and positions of the Chinese government and its officials. For subjects where the Chinese government may be a stakeholder, the consensus is almost unanimous that Xinhua cannot be trusted to cover them accurately and dispassionately; some editors favour outright deprecation because of its lack of editorial independence. There is no consensus for applying any one single label to the whole of the agency. Caution should be exercised in using this source, extremely so in case of extraordinary claims on controversial subjects or biographies of living people. When in doubt, try to find better sources instead; use inline attribution if you must use Xinhua.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nYouTube WP:RSPYT\u00a0\ud83d\udccc\n\n\n\n\u00a02020\n+21[au]\n\n\n2020\n\nMost videos on YouTube are anonymous, self-published, and unverifiable, and should not be used at all. Content uploaded from a verified official account, such as that of a news organization, may be treated as originating from the uploader and therefore inheriting their level of reliability. However, many YouTube videos from unofficial accounts are copyright violations and should not be linked from Wikipedia, according to WP:COPYLINK. See also WP:YOUTUBE and WP:VIDEOLINK.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nZDNet\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n2018\n\nZDNet is considered generally reliable for technology-related articles.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nZero Hedge (ZH)WP:ZEROHEDGE\u00a0\ud83d\udccc\n\n\n\n\u00a02020\n1 2 3\n\n\n2020\n\nZero Hedge was deprecated in the 2020 RfC due to its propagation of conspiracy theories. It is a self-published blog that is biased or opinionated.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nZoomInfo\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a02020\n1 2\n\n\n2020\n\nDue to persistent abuse, ZoomInfo is currently on the Wikipedia spam blacklist, and links must be whitelisted before they can be used.\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCategories[edit]\nSelf-published peerage websites[edit]\nThe following self-published peerage websites have been deprecated in requests for comment:\n\n\nalmanach.be\u00a0\u00a0\nalmanachdegotha.org\u00a0\u00a0\nangelfire.com/realm/gotha\u00a0\u00a0\nchivalricorders.org\u00a0\u00a0\ncracroftspeerage.co.uk\u00a0\u00a0\nenglishmonarchs.co.uk\u00a0\u00a0\njacobite.ca\u00a0\u00a0\nroyalark.net\u00a0\u00a0\nthepeerage.com\u00a0\u00a0\nworldstatesmen.org\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSee \u00a7\u00a0Peerage websites for the corresponding entry.\n\nState-sponsored fake news sites[edit]\nA limited number of sites are identified by credible sources (e.g. the EU's anti-disinformation East Stratcom Task Force) as disseminators of fake news. Many of these are state-sponsored. These sites are considered unreliable and should be blacklisted when identified.

A topic which can be sourced exclusively to student media, with no evidence of wider coverage in mass market general interest media, is not likely to be viewed as notable.\n\nSee
