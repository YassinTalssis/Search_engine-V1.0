This WikiProject is dedicated to improving the reliability of Wikipedia articles. We ensure that articles are supported by reliable sources, answer inquiries on the reliable sources noticeboard, and maintain a list of frequently discussed sources. This project works to achieve the goals of the verifiability and no original research policies. If you would like to help, please join the project, participate on the talk page and see the open tasks below.\n\nGetting started\nDo you have an article/fact/reference that needs checking? See the guidelines for help with tagging articles for review and correction.\nDo you need help creating citations?  See the Referencing for beginners and Citing sources pages for information on how to write references and create citations\nDo you want to help improve the reliability of Wikipedia? Lend a hand with some of the open tasks, and add your name to the participants list.\nDo you have a question?  Please feel free to comment on the project talk page, and someone will try to help as soon as possible!\nGive me something simple to do! There are over 426,891 \"Citation needed\" statements on Wikipedia. Click here to use the Citation Hunt tool which makes it easy to pick one to fix.\n\nScope and goals\nScope\nThis WikiProject covers all articles on Wikipedia.\n\nGoals\nEnsure that content in articles is verifiable\nIdentify and tag claims that require verification with appropriate templates\nPerform fact and reference checks for articles with verification templates\nProvide assistance with factual verification to editors\nImprove the reliability of sources cited in articles\nAdd citations to reliable sources\nReplace citations to questionable sources with citations to better sources\nRemove content supported by questionable sources when it is unsupported by reliable sources\nParticipate in discussions on the reliable sources noticeboard\nAffirm sources that have a reputation for accuracy, fact-checking, and error-correction\nChallenge questionable sources, including self-published sources authored by non-experts, sponsored content, and spam\nMaintain the list of perennial sources\nAdd perennial sources that are missing from the page\nIndex new discussions from the reliable sources noticeboard\nUpdate entries when noticeboard discussions are archived\n\nGuidelines\nArticles with no references\nFor an article with no citations, add the template {{unreferenced}} to the beginning of the article to flag it for review and addition of citations. This will automatically add the article to Category:Articles lacking sources.\n\nArticles based on a single source\nIf the article has only one reference or external link (that is related to the article content), use {{one source}} to put the article in Category:Articles lacking sources.\n\nArticles with partial or incomplete sources\nFor an article with partial sources, add the templates {{refimprove}} or {{primary sources}}. This will automatically add the article to Category:Articles needing additional references or Category:Articles lacking reliable references.\n\nArticles with questionable resources\nFor an article with questionable resources, add the templates {{verify source}} or {{verify credibility}} to put the article in to Category:Wikipedia articles needing factual verification.\n\nArticles with statements that lack references\nFor an article with small numbers of statements lacking references, add the template {{citation needed}} or {{citations missing}}. This will automatically add the article to Category:Articles with unsourced statements.\nOther maintenance templates are available at Category:Citation and verifiability maintenance templates.\n\n\nOpen tasks\nHow can I help now?\nThere are a number of different Wikipedia Backlog categories that help track the existing backlog of referencing activities. They fall into two major groups, Lacking References and Ensuring Accuracy through existing references:\n\n\n\n\nLacking references\n\nNeeds references: 158,356\nNeeds references (BLP): 2,014\nNeeds more references: 407,429\nNeeds more references (BLP): 33,858\nNeeds in-text citations: 98,887\nNeeds reliable references: 77,345\nHas unsourced quotes: 1,231\nHas unsourced statements: 426,891 Fix one!\n\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy\n\nUses broken or outdated citations: 100\nUses deprecated sources: 354\nNeeds factual verification: 8,365\nNeeds references list: 52\nNeeds references clean up: 1,933\nAccuracy disputes: 8,630\nNeutrality disputed: 6,264\nNeeds updating: 29,345\nHas original research: 16,309\nSelf-contradictory: 559\n\nHelp now: Solve Citations Needed!\nAt the moment, there are over 426,891 articles with \"Citation needed\" statements. They are some of the easiest referencing issues to solve, because you are frequently looking for a targeted and singular reference. You can browse the whole list of these articles at Category:All articles with unsourced statements.\nWith 426,891 statements that need WP:Verification, sometimes it's hard to choose which article to work on. The tool Citation Hunt makes that easier by suggesting random articles, which you can sort by topical category membership. \n\nI can help! Give me a random citation to find!\n\nParticipants\nParticipants\nIf you wish to join the project, please add your name to the list with:\n\n\n#{{np2|Your username}} ~~~~~\n\n\nJoin WikiProject
